Depth Information in object detection
#June 2019
Depth information by stereo matching is an important feature to seprate background and foreground.
Object detection also is a challengic problem, specially when you work on something like Pedestrians.

To run files you need OpenCV and visual studio
Create an empty VS project and add existing file, each file can be used separately.
Combination these files by your own leads to a compate project which I will share in the future
